/*In the previous video,
 Derek outlines how to compare a row to a previous
 or subsequent row.This technique can be useful
 when analyzing time - based events.Imagine you 're an analyst at Parch & Posey and you want to determine how the current order' s total revenue (
 "total" meaning
 from sales of all types of paper
 ) compares to the next order 's total revenue.
 
 
 
 Modify Derek' s query
 from the previous video in the SQL Explorer below to perform this analysis.You 'll need to use occurred_at and total_amt_usd in the orders table along with LEAD to do so. In your query results, there should be four columns: occurred_at, total_amt_usd, lead, and lead_difference.*/
